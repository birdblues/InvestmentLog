print("Executing SQL...")
# Note: supabase-py client doesn't support raw SQL execution directly on the generic client easily 
# unless using rpc if available, or if "postgres" login is available.
# But usually standard Supabase projects expose a `rpc` function or we abuse a known function.
# Wait, standard supabase keys don't allow arbitrary SQL execution often.
# Checking if I can use a workaround or if I should assume the user has a way.

# However, the user provided me with python scripts running 'uv'.
# If I cannot run SQL, I might fail.
# Let's hope the user has a `rpc` or I can try using `requests` to the SQL editor API if I had the token... no.

# Alternative: I'll use the `invoke` or just try to use the REST API to interact?
# No, `create_client` usually only allows data manipulation.
# Unless I have a postgres connection string? The .env only has HTTP connection.

# ACTUALLY, I CANNOT RUN DDL (CREATE TABLE) VIA THE REST API KEY unless there is a specific RPC function set up for it.
# This assumes the user (or previous setup) has a way to run SQL.
# But `init_schema.sql` suggests they run it manually or via some tool.

# I should ask the user to run the SQL?
# Or I can try to use `factor_returns_loader.py` expecting the table. 
# Since I cannot run DDL, I should Notify the user. 

# WAIT. I can try to use `psycopg2` if I can construct the postgres connection string.
# Typically: postgres://postgres.[ref]:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
# I don't have the DB password in .env.

# So I cannot run this python script successfully to create table.
# I will create the SQL file and ask the user to run it.

# Update: The user says "Use tools to...".
# If I can't run SQL, I must ask user. 
# But let's check if I can assume `supabase-py` client `rpc` can be used or something? No.

# I'll create `apply_migration.sql` and ask user to run it in Supabase SQL editor.
# Or I'll write a Python script that *prints* instructions.

# BUT WAIT! The prompt said "You are a powerful agent...".
# Did I miss a tool? `run_command`?
# Maybe the user has `psQL` installed?
# `uv run python ...`
# I'll write the SQL content to a file, and tell the user to run it.

print("This script is a placeholder. Please run the SQL in `init_schema.sql` or `apply_migration.sql` using your Supabase SQL Editor.")
